But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>

this string:

üëâ Exercise 27<br>
In an HTML string, find all the elements (including surrounding tags). That is, find strings that start with a string in angle brackets (for example, '&lt;i>') and end with a string in angle brackets that starts with a slash (for example, '&lt;/i>'). HTML strings may be multiline.
<br>
Note: You don't yet have the tools to deal with nested elements <br> (like &lt;p>Don't you just &ltb>love&lt/b> regexes?&lt;/p>). We will discuss this case in the section on capture groups!
